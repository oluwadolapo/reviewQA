My kids love it. The puzzle pieces are durable and sturdy. My kids march the dinosaurs around and pretend games with them as well as just doing the puzzle. I am glad I bought this for them.","It's intentionally deceptive marketing, but does any of that really matter in the practical sense?I think it does.Medium density fiberboard (MDF) is nasty stuff. Containing a higher resin-to-wood ration than any other pressed wood product, MDF emits VOCs for at least a few months after manufacture and emits urea formaldehyde for the duration of its life.","As the paint wears away, it becomes apparent that these puzzle pieces are nothing but pressed paper-like sawdust material. When revealed beneath the chipped-off paint, this dry, dusty substance easily flakes off where it can get into little mouths and become part of the general household dust.Okay, so Melissa and Doug fudged a little on their description, which was prominently displayed on the packaging for our puzzle.","Also, since the side and back is not painted on each piece, the MDF is a little rough and scratchy for little hands and it blends in with the carpet, they are constantly being stepped on when they end up on the floor. The farm animals puzzle pieces were individually painted however, and this made up for the MDF on these.","I have to say I'm very disappointed with the quality of this puzzle and in Melissa & Doug for allowing their products to be produced this way. They have been known for the quality of their wooden toys but it seems that quantity now matters more. I gave it 3 stars only because my twins seem to like playing with them.I purchased this puzzle along with the \"farm animals\" one and they are both made from MDF, but as others have said the pieces on this one were not individually painted.","very sturdy wood pieces. my son loves the bright colors. well built, not like some of the cardboard ones out there. will definately order another one","My 22 month old son loves this puzzle. The pieces are easy for him to pick up and he has learned to \"adjust\" each piece so it fits into its correct slot.","as others have pointed out, the pieces aren't \"wood\" in any sense that the average buyer would agree. they're not cut out of solid pieces of dried tree. and when they start to go - or when a dog gets ahold of one, or a child with a particularly tenacious chewing habit, they disintegrate in minutes.I am sorely disappointed in the company - misleading labeling guarantees I won't be a repeat buyer.","I was very dissapointed in this puzzle!! The quality is NOT \"good\" as in the description, but very POOR!! My one year old son received it yesterday as a birthday gift and my inital excitement over this very colorful and pretty seeming puzzle turned into mere dissapointment: in a matter of only 5 minutes a piece of the ply wood (the puzzle is made of) came off one of the pieces! My son could have swallowed it, if I would have not noticed.","This is from all external appearances a great little puzzle. It's certainly a great concept for a 'first' puzzle, with it's bright fun aesthetically-appealing dinosaurs and easy-match puzzle board. It is certainly educational, and when I bought it I felt pretty good about my kids playing with it.We own the older style - painted 'wooden' pieces.

Slowing it down increases run time, but decreases cutting power. For grass and light stalks, this works well on low. For heavier brush, you will need full power which decreases run time.

I would have used it longer, but I had cleared everything I needed to do in that time.4.","And this was with a large handlebar and shoulder strap.

As far as the operation as a string cutter is concerned, this is equal to my 4-cycle trimmer which I routinely use to attack tall brush and overgrowth.The battery lasted longer than I cared to work so it will be sufficient for my use.

The two pieces of the shaft push together and then a clamp holds it in place. The line guard is held in place with two screws, the handle has a lever wedge design that basically unscrews to install and then you screw the lever back into place. Done!

Time to install the battery (important note, the battery must fully engage and there is an audible click when it is fully seated) about 30 seconds.2. The shaft has a long reach which is perfect for those drainage ditch and hill side situations. The balance is good so there is not a lot of arm strain. This unit does not have a harness, so I would probably not recommend using it for several hours at a time.","I just purchased this trimmer. It is very powerful and knocks down all weeds and grass, and does a great job of edging lawn. The only downsides are that this tool is heavy and the battery does not last very long even when I only have it on the #2 power setting.
